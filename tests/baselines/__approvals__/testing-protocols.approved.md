This project enforces **3** testing methodologies. When writing or verifying tests, follow the applicable protocols below and report the checks, assertions, or verification artifacts you produced before concluding.

### TDD

- **What:** Test-Driven Development — red-green-refactor loop
- **When to apply:** Any project where correctness matters and requirements can be expressed as assertions before the code is written. Especially valuable for greenfield features and critical business logic.
- **Key tools:** Jest, Vitest, Mocha, pytest, JUnit, RSpec, Go testing
- **Primary owner:** Test Developer

### Unit Testing

- **What:** Isolated function and class-level tests
- **When to apply:** All projects. Start here. Fast, cheap, and gives precise regression signals. Should be the largest layer of your test pyramid.
- **Key tools:** Jest, Vitest, Mocha, pytest, JUnit, NUnit, xUnit, Go testing, Minitest
- **Primary owner:** Test Developer

### Property-Based

- **What:** Generative input testing (fast-check, Hypothesis)
- **When to apply:** Pure functions, parsers, data transformers, and algorithmic code. Generates hundreds of random inputs to find edge cases no human would enumerate.
- **Key tools:** fast-check (JS/TS), Hypothesis (Python), QuickCheck (Haskell/Erlang), jqwik (Java), gopter (Go)
- **Primary owner:** Test Developer
- **Project notes:** Pure derivations only.
