---

## v0.49.37 — Chat Focus Guard

- Guarded automatic Atlas chat composer focus restoration so transcript refreshes no longer steal the editor cursor after the user clicks back into another VS Code surface

## v0.49.36 — Testing Policy Card

- Added a dedicated Testing policy highlight card to the Project Dashboard beside the framework and coverage stats
- Added an optional workspace override label so teams can show their own tests-first wording without changing AtlasMind's verification safeguards

## v0.49.36 — In-Chat Generated Skill Review

- Warning-level generated-skill reviews now appear in the AtlasMind in-chat approval stack instead of a separate modal flow
- The approval card now shows the warning context and a focused one-time Allow Once versus Keep Blocked choice

## v0.49.35 — Generated Skill Review Gate

- Auto-generated skills that hit warning-level scanner findings now pause for explicit user approval before AtlasMind evaluates them in-process
- Added a review-first path so operators can inspect the draft and either allow it once or keep it blocked for refinement

## v0.49.34 — Project Dashboard Testing Explorer

- Moved the main testing inventory into the Project Dashboard so test health is shown alongside runtime, delivery, and SSOT signals
- Added searchable and category-grouped per-test browsing with a jump dropdown plus a detail inspector that opens the relevant source file at the right line

## v0.49.33 — MCP Intent Heuristics And Memory Recall

- AtlasMind now derives natural-language routing cues for third-party MCP tools, biases tool selection toward the most likely match for prompts like “commit”, and asks for clarification when multiple tools look similarly plausible
- Successful natural-language-to-MCP resolutions are now written into project memory so future turns can reuse that learned mapping

## v0.49.32 — Keyboard Rename In Sessions

- Made F2 rename use the currently focused Sessions sidebar item so keyboard rename now works reliably for chat threads and session folders

## v0.49.31 — Marketplace Badge Replacement

- Replaced the external README Marketplace badge with a plain version callout so the extension page no longer shows a broken or retired badge placeholder in VS Code surfaces

## v0.39.7 — Immutable Guardrails Baseline

- Added a non-overrideable legal and human-respect baseline to built-in and routed AtlasMind agent prompts
- Restricted jurisdictionally ambiguous legal asks to safe high-level guidance and blocked person-targeted harmful, defamatory, or deceptive assistance in generated tools

## v0.39.6 — Sidebar Default Order

- Reordered the default AtlasMind sidebar tree views to Project Runs, Sessions, Memory, Agents, Skills, MCP Servers, and Models
- Set those tree views to ship collapsed by default while keeping stable view ids so VS Code continues remembering each user's custom order and open-state preferences

## v0.39.6 — Sidebar Quick Actions

- Added title-bar shortcuts for Settings, Project Dashboard, and Cost Dashboard across the Chat, Sessions, and Memory sidebar views
- Switched the project-memory toolbar action between `Import Existing Project` and `Update Project Memory` based on whether AtlasMind has detected workspace SSOT state

## v0.39.4 — Command Naming Guardrails

- Hid the remaining unprefixed session actions from the Command Palette and added a manifest-level guard so unprefixed command titles stay view-local
- Split the README command reference into explicit Command Palette and Sidebar Actions sections

## v0.39.3 — Command Surface Cleanup

- Hid sidebar-only actions from the Command Palette so palette-visible AtlasMind commands stay reserved for top-level entry points
- Split the command docs between palette-facing AtlasMind commands and view-local sidebar actions

## v0.39.2 — Persistent Memory Drift Signal

- Added a pinned warning row at the top of the Memory tree so stale imported SSOT remains visible while browsing entries
- Treated legacy `#import` SSOT files without Atlas metadata trailers as stale imported memory so older projects also surface the refresh signal

## v0.39.2 — Skills Panel Folders

- Grouped built-in skills into sidebar categories so the bundled set no longer expands as one flat list
- Added persistent custom skill folders, including a Skills title-bar `Create Skill Folder` action and folder-aware add/import flows
- Added `F2` rename support for highlighted chat-session rows in the Sessions sidebar

## v0.39.0 — Filed Session Sidebar

- Added persistent folders to the Sessions sidebar so related chat threads can be filed together instead of staying in one flat list
- Added an inline rename action on each session row plus move-to-folder and create-folder commands in the Sessions tree
- Moved the optional `Import Existing Project` toolbar shortcut from the Sessions view to the Memory view

## v0.38.22 — Cost Dashboard Visual Refresh

- Reworked the Cost Dashboard to share the Project Dashboard's stronger visual language with a cleaner shell, animated metric cards, a more professional budget meter, and upgraded model and feedback panels
- Replaced the old checkbox and numeric day input with a topbar visibility toggle and chart-overlay time-range controls inside the Daily Spend panel
- Tightened summary-card layout so the primary spend metrics stay on one row instead of wrapping into a cluttered grid

## v0.38.21 — Responsive Chat Sessions Rail

- Made the shared Atlas chat Sessions area responsive so it remains a top strip in narrow layouts and becomes a persistent left sidebar when the webview reaches 1000px wide

## v0.38.20 — Dashboard Settings Compatibility

- Fixed the Project Dashboard refresh path so array-backed `autoVerifyScripts` settings from AtlasMind Settings no longer break the dashboard security snapshot
- Added regression coverage for the dashboard configuration compatibility path

## v0.38.19 — Inline Chat Feedback Controls

- Moved assistant-response vote controls onto the same footer row as the thinking summary and aligned them to the right edge of the bubble
- Replaced emoji-style thumbs with compact outlined thumb icons for a quieter chat UI

## v0.38.18 — Feedback-Aware Cost Dashboard

- Added Cost Dashboard feedback analytics showing per-model approval rate, thumbs totals, and spend on rated models
- Added `atlasmind.feedbackRoutingWeight` so thumbs-based routing bias can be disabled or tuned without clearing vote history
- Updated recent-request rows to show the recorded feedback state for each linked assistant response

## v0.38.17 — Chat Session Header Fit

- Tightened the shared Atlas chat Sessions header so the new-session control stays inline with the label and no longer pushes the collapsible bar partly out of view

## v0.38.16 — Cost To Chat Deep Links

- Added session-aware links from Cost Dashboard recent-request rows back to the matching chat transcript entry when the session still exists
- Stored optional chat session and message references with cost records so AtlasMind can reopen the exact assistant response that produced a charge

## v0.38.14 — Memory Freshness Signals

- Added startup SSOT freshness checks for imported workspaces so AtlasMind can warn when generated memory has drifted behind the codebase
- Added an `Update Project Memory` Memory-view action that reruns the import pipeline against the latest workspace state
- Fixed import body fingerprint normalization so unchanged generated files are not treated as manually edited or permanently stale on later refreshes

## v0.38.13 — Cost Dashboard Polishing

- Sent the Cost Dashboard budget shortcut to Settings → Overview with a budget-focused query instead of reopening the last active settings page
- Clarified the recent-requests table so the final column is explicitly the per-message request cost

## v0.38.11 — Dashboard Reliability And Access

- Fixed the Project Dashboard loading path so git timeline collection no longer stalls the panel and failures render a visible error state instead of hanging on the loading screen
- Added a direct Project Dashboard action to the AtlasMind sidebar chat view title bar
- Restored clean TypeScript compilation after the project-memory bootstrap refactor left import-scan metadata incomplete

## v0.38.10 — Subscription-Aware Cost Tracking

- Added subscription-aware cost accounting so only direct and overflow-billed requests count toward the daily budget while included subscription usage remains visible for analysis
- Upgraded the Cost Dashboard with adjustable day windows, an exclude-subscriptions toggle, and explicit per-request billing labels

## v0.38.7 — Runtime Extensibility And Project Dashboard

- Added an explicit shared-runtime plugin API with lifecycle events and plugin contribution manifests for extension-host and CLI integrations
- Added the AtlasMind Project Dashboard surface with interactive pages for repo health, runtime state, SSOT coverage, security posture, delivery workflow, and review-readiness signals
- Hardened CLI argument parsing and expanded the architecture, development, contribution, and wiki guidance for runtime extensibility, diagnostics, and operational review

## v0.38.6 — Final Observability Sync

- Synced the `v0.38.x` roadmap branch with the newly merged workspace-observability base changes so the terminal-reader, extensions/Ports, cost dashboard, and ElevenLabs work remains mergeable on top of the latest `develop` head

## v0.38.5 — Final Roadmap Branch Sync

- Synced the `v0.38.x` roadmap branch with the latest `develop` EXA search, workspace observability, and settings-documentation updates while preserving the terminal-reader, extensions/Ports, cost dashboard, and ElevenLabs feature work

## v0.38.4 — Settings Docs Sync

- Synced the `v0.38.x` roadmap branch with the latest `develop` settings-documentation updates so it stays mergeable on top of the new configuration hover-help work

## v0.38.3 — Roadmap Branch Re-Sync

- Synced the `v0.38.0` roadmap-completion branch with the latest `develop` observability changes while preserving its terminal-reader, extension, Ports, dashboard, and ElevenLabs feature work

## v0.38.2 — CI Workflow Repair

- Removed duplicate `if` keys from the CI workflow coverage steps so the `v0.38.x` roadmap branch can execute GitHub Actions normally again after the develop sync

## v0.38.1 — Roadmap Branch Sync

- Synced the `v0.38.0` roadmap-completion branch with the latest `develop` fixes so the extension-skill, terminal-reader, Ports, cost dashboard, and ElevenLabs work remains mergeable on top of the newer review-cleanup and lint-gate repairs

## v0.38.0 — Roadmap Goals Resolved

- **Terminal session readers** — new `terminal-read` skill and `getTerminalOutput()` context method; informs AtlasMind which terminals are open and guides the user to paste content.
- **Test result file parsing** — `workspace-state` skill now parses JUnit XML and Vitest/Jest JSON result files and includes pass/fail counts and coverage percentages in the workspace snapshot.
- **VS Code Extensions skill** (`vscode-extensions`) — lists installed extensions with version and active state, tags top-50 popular extensions, filters by name, and reports forwarded ports from the VS Code Ports panel.
- **Cost Management Dashboard** (`atlasmind.openCostDashboard`) — full-page webview with daily spend bar chart, per-model cost breakdown, budget utilisation bar, and recent-requests table.
- **ElevenLabs TTS integration** — Voice Panel now uses ElevenLabs server-side audio synthesis when an API key is configured; falls back to Web Speech API.

## v0.37.4 — Workspace Observability

- Added the `workspace-observability` built-in skill plus the supporting debug-session, terminal, and test-result host hooks with safe CLI fallbacks
- Hardened the observability path so missing host hooks degrade safely and test-result output remains bounded

## v0.37.3 — Settings Docs Sync

- Synced the `v0.37.x` feature branch with the latest `develop` settings-documentation updates so the EXA search, observability, and CLI subcommand work stays mergeable on top of the new configuration hover-help changes

## v0.37.2 — EXA And Observability Branch Sync

- Synced the `v0.37.0` feature branch with the latest `develop` fixes so the EXA search, observability, and CLI subcommand work stays mergeable on top of the newer review-cleanup and lint-gate repairs

## v0.37.0 — Observability, EXA Search & CLI Dev Subcommands

- EXA AI search specialist runtime (`exa-search` skill)
- Debug session inspector skill (`debug-session`)
- Workspace state skill (`workspace-state`)
- CLI `build`, `lint`, and `test` subcommands with `--dry-run`, `--fix`, and `--watch` flags
- Amazon Bedrock model catalog expanded with 16 additional entries

## v0.36.26 — Lint Gate Repair

- Replaced non-reassigned `let` declarations in the orchestrator task-attempt path so `develop` passes the current lint gate again

## v0.36.25 — Review Cleanup Follow-up

- Removed the duplicate Tool Webhooks command entry from the wiki command reference and normalized provider registry indentation to the repo's standard TypeScript style

## v0.36.24 — Review Follow-up Fixes

- Repaired the Project Run Center webview string assembly so its preview, run summary, and artifact views no longer generate invalid JavaScript
- Restored a nonce-only script policy for shared webviews, fixed broken CLI wiki links, and normalized the duplicated `v0.36.4` changelog history

## v0.36.23 — Workspace Observability Compatibility Fix

- Added safe CLI fallback implementations for workspace observability context methods so the shared `SkillExecutionContext` contract is satisfied outside the VS Code host
- Adjusted workspace observability test-results access so the extension compiles cleanly even when the typed VS Code API surface does not expose a stable `testResults` property

## v0.36.22 — Workspace Observability Skill

- Added `workspace-observability` built-in skill: snapshots the active debug session, open integrated terminals, and most recent test run results in one call
- Added `getTestResults()`, `getActiveDebugSession()`, and `listTerminals()` to `SkillExecutionContext`, backed by `vscode.tests`, `vscode.debug`, and `vscode.window.terminals`

## v0.36.21 — Extension Interoperability Roadmap

- Expanded the roadmap to cover interoperability with the top 50 commonly used VS Code developer extensions, their interface surfaces such as Output and Terminal, Ports view support, and explicit safety boundaries for extension interaction

## v0.36.20 — CI Artifact Upload Fix

- Restricted CI coverage generation and coverage artifact upload to the Ubuntu matrix leg, preventing duplicate artifact-name conflicts while preserving compile, lint, and test coverage across Ubuntu, Windows, and macOS
- Updated the developer-facing docs to reflect the actual CI matrix behavior and Ubuntu-only coverage artifact publishing path

## v0.36.19 — CI Repair Follow-up

- Fixed the lint and TypeScript issues that were blocking CI on the protected develop-to-master promotion path

## v0.36.18 — Observability Roadmap Additions

- Added roadmap items for workspace observability, debug-session integration, and safe output or terminal readers so AtlasMind can eventually reason over more of the active VS Code environment

## v0.36.17 — Workstation-Aware Responses

- AtlasMind now includes workstation context in routed prompts so responses can default to the active environment, including Windows and PowerShell guidance inside VS Code when appropriate
- Added regression coverage for workstation-aware prompt context in native chat and orchestrator message building

## v0.36.16 — Provider Failover

- AtlasMind now fails over to another eligible provider when the initially selected provider errors or is missing, instead of ending the task immediately on the first provider failure
- Added orchestrator regression coverage for cross-provider failover after provider-side errors

## v0.36.15 — OpenAI Fixed-Temperature Compatibility

- OpenAI modern chat payloads now omit `temperature` for fixed-temperature model families such as GPT-5 and the `o`-series, preventing request failures on models that reject that parameter
- Added regression coverage to keep OpenAI modern, Azure OpenAI, and generic compatible providers on the correct parameter contract

## v0.36.14 — Early Difficulty Escalation

- AtlasMind now detects repeated tool-loop struggle signals and can reroute once to a stronger reasoning-capable model instead of spending the full loop budget on a failing route
- Added regression coverage for bounded mid-task model escalation after repeated failed tool calls

## v0.36.13 — Grounded Version Answers

- AtlasMind now answers version questions from the root `package.json` manifest instead of depending on model inference
- If the manifest is unavailable, AtlasMind falls back to SSOT memory so repo-fact answers still come from grounded project context

## v0.36.12 — Provider-Specific OpenAI Compatibility

- Split OpenAI-family payload handling by provider so OpenAI and Azure use `developer` plus `max_completion_tokens`, while generic OpenAI-compatible endpoints retain `system` plus `max_tokens`
- Added regression tests to lock the expected contract for OpenAI, Azure OpenAI, and third-party OpenAI-compatible providers

## v0.36.11 — OpenAI-Compatible Token Parameter Fix

- Updated OpenAI-compatible request payloads to send `max_completion_tokens` instead of `max_tokens`, resolving 400 errors from models that reject the legacy parameter
- Added regression coverage to verify AtlasMind no longer emits `max_tokens` in OpenAI-style chat completion requests

## v0.36.10 — Terminal Tool Schema Validation Fix

- Fixed the built-in `terminal-run` tool schema so `args` is declared as an array of strings, resolving chat failures from OpenAI function schema validation
- Added a regression test to keep the terminal tool schema compatible with function-calling providers

## v0.36.6 — CLI Safety Gate And Narrower SSOT Auto-Load

- AtlasMind CLI now allows read-only tools by default, requires an explicit `--allow-writes` flag before workspace or git writes are permitted, and blocks external high-risk tools in CLI mode
- Startup SSOT auto-load now trusts only the configured SSOT path or the default `project_memory/` folder instead of treating workspace-root marker folders as sufficient
- Added regression tests covering CLI tool gating and the tightened startup SSOT detection boundary

## v0.36.5 — Import Freshness And Memory Purge Safeguards

- `/import` now records generator metadata, skips unchanged generated files on repeat imports, and preserves imported SSOT files that were manually edited
- AtlasMind now generates both `index/import-catalog.md` and `index/import-freshness.md` so memory refresh status stays reviewable
- The Project Settings page now exposes a destructive memory-purge action protected by a modal confirmation plus a required `PURGE MEMORY` confirmation phrase

## v0.36.4 — MCP, Voice, And Vision Workspaces

- Reworked the MCP Servers, Voice, and Vision panels into the same searchable multi-page workspace pattern used by AtlasMind Settings and the other admin surfaces
- Added richer sidebar empty-state links so sessions, models, agents, MCP, and project runs can jump directly to the matching panel or settings page

## v0.36.3 — Richer Project Import Baseline

- Expanded `/import` so it generates a deeper SSOT baseline from manifests, docs, workflow/security guidance, and a focused codebase map
- Import now upgrades the starter `project_soul.md` template when it is still blank so Atlas begins with a more useful project identity

## v0.36.2 — Deep-Linked Panel Workspaces

- Reworked the Agent Manager and Tool Webhooks panels into searchable multi-page workspaces consistent with AtlasMind Settings and the provider surfaces
- Added page-specific settings commands so sidebar actions and walkthrough steps can open the exact chat, models, safety, or project settings page directly

## v0.36.1 — Searchable Provider Workspaces

- Reworked the Model Providers and Specialist Integrations panels into searchable multi-page workspaces with grouped cards instead of single dense tables
- Added deep-linkable AtlasMind Settings navigation so provider surfaces can reopen Settings directly on the Models page

## v0.36.0 — Shared Runtime And CLI

- Added a compiled `atlasmind` CLI with `chat`, `project`, `memory`, and `providers` commands backed by the same orchestrator and SSOT memory pipeline as the extension
- Introduced a shared runtime builder plus Node-hosted memory, cost, and skill-context adapters so AtlasMind can run outside the VS Code host without forking core logic

## v0.35.15 — Accessible Settings Workspace

- Reworked AtlasMind Settings into a multi-page workspace with a persistent section nav instead of a long collapsible form
- Added faster in-panel shortcuts to the embedded Chat view, detached chat panel, provider management, and specialist integrations

## v0.35.12 — Startup SSOT Auto-Load

- AtlasMind now auto-detects and loads an existing workspace SSOT during startup when the configured `atlasmind.ssotPath` is missing
- The Memory sidebar now refreshes immediately after startup indexing so existing project memory appears without a manual reload

## v0.35.5 — Models Tree Refresh Action

- Added a refresh action on configured provider rows in the Models sidebar so routed model catalogs can be refreshed directly where missing models are noticed

## v0.35.4 — Follow-Up Routing Escalation Fix

- Adjusted routing so important thread-based follow-up turns can escalate away from weak local models instead of being dominated by zero-cost local scoring
- Updated the task profiler and router scoring so high-stakes conversation follow-ups can favor stronger reasoning-capable models when appropriate

## v0.35.3 — Memory Sidebar Edit And Review Actions

- Added inline edit and review actions to Memory sidebar entries so SSOT files can be opened directly or summarized before editing

## v0.35.2 — Get Started Chat Shortcut Fix

- Added a working `Ctrl+Alt+I` (`Cmd+Alt+I` on macOS) shortcut for `AtlasMind: Open Chat Panel`
- Updated the Get Started walkthrough chat buttons to open the AtlasMind chat panel directly

## v0.35.1 — Sidebar Settings Shortcut And Optional Import Action

- Added an AtlasMind Settings entry to the overflow menu of AtlasMind sidebar views so the settings panel can be opened directly from the panel itself
- Added an optional Import Existing Project toolbar action to the Sessions view, with a new `atlasmind.showImportProjectAction` setting to hide it when not wanted

## v0.35.0 — Session Workspace And Sessions Sidebar

- Upgraded the dedicated AtlasMind chat panel into a session workspace with persistent workspace chat threads and a session rail
- Added a Sessions sidebar view that lists chat sessions and autonomous runs together, with direct handoff into the Project Run Center for live run steering

## v0.34.2 — Deferred Copilot Permission Prompt

- Deferred GitHub Copilot model discovery and health checks until explicit activation so AtlasMind no longer prompts for Copilot language-model access during normal startup

## v0.34.1 — NVIDIA NIM Model Info Link Fix

- Corrected the NVIDIA NIM model info link so AtlasMind opens NVIDIA's model catalog instead of an unrelated API page

## v0.34.0 — Dedicated AtlasMind Chat Panel

- Added a dedicated AtlasMind chat panel for users who want a standalone conversation UI instead of only the built-in VS Code Chat view
- Added a Settings shortcut and command-palette entry for opening the panel

## v0.33.1 — Copilot Chat Recommendation Cleanup

- Added routed provider support for Azure OpenAI with deployment-based workspace configuration and `api-key` authentication
- Added routed provider support for Amazon Bedrock through a dedicated SigV4-signed adapter
- Added a Specialist Integrations panel for non-routing search, voice, image, and video vendors

## v0.32.10 — Default Branch And Release Flow Hardening

- Switched the repository default branch to `develop`
- Locked `master` to the `develop` to `master` pre-release promotion flow
- Updated contributor and Copilot guidance to treat `develop` as the normal development push target

## v0.32.5 — Configurable Local Provider

- Added a real configurable local provider path backed by `atlasmind.localOpenAiBaseUrl` and an optional SecretStorage API key
- Local provider setup can now be completed directly from the Models and Model Providers surfaces

## v0.32.4 — Provider Configuration And Agent Assignment

- Added inline provider configure and assign-to-agent actions in the Models sidebar
- Added model-level assign-to-agent actions for quick `allowedModels` updates
- Hid child model rows for unconfigured providers until the provider is configured

## v0.32.3 — Models Sidebar Controls

- Added inline enable/disable and info actions to provider and model rows in the Models sidebar
- Persisted provider/model availability choices so routing keeps honoring them after restarts and model catalog refreshes

## v0.32.2 — Agent Restore Activation Fix

- Removed the activation-time dependency on the Agent Manager webview so persisted user agents can be restored without loading panel UI code during startup

## v0.32.1 — Lazy Command Panel Loading

- Changed AtlasMind command handlers to lazy-load panel modules so panel-specific runtime issues cannot block command registration during activation

## v0.32.0 — Getting Started Command

- Added `AtlasMind: Getting Started` so the onboarding walkthrough can be reopened directly from the Command Palette
